# Data Modeling - Design & Development of A2A System

My colleague Aleksandar Martic and I were designing and developing an information system called ‘A2A System’ utilizing the following Data Modeling Tools:

1. Context Diagram - EdrawMax
2. I and II Level of Decomposition - EdrawMax
3. Data Dictionary 
4. Extended Model Connection Objects (EMCO) - EdrawMax
5. Translating EMCO into a Relational Data Model - ER Win
6. Use Case Diagram - UML 
7. Conceptual Class Diagram - UML 
8. System Sequence Diagram (SSD) - UML
9. Detailed Class Diagram - UML
10. MVC Architectural Pattern

Both Aleksandar and I were involved in every step of the development and mastering of the modeling tools.

**Later, this project was improved by utilizing AI algorithms (research project A2A PROSIG System).
